# humans-vs-ai
This is a game I built while learning Vue.js

### Tasks : 

1) Add the turn number before the ```<li>``` in the log. <b>Example :</b> Turn {{ # }} : You hit the ai for {{damage}}.
<br>

2) If either class's damage does 0 change the text to ```<i>[Class] missed....</i>```
<br>

### Rules : 
1) If you are able to complete the task, submit a PR, and I will mark the task off the list.
